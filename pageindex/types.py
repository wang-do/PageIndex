"""Config shapes for the constructor's ``index=`` / ``chat=`` slots.

The slots are the grouped spelling of the flat constructor arguments —
the same arguments with the side prefix factored out of the names
(``index={"model": ...}`` is ``index_model=``), one spelling per side.
A dict declares its
side by its keys (cloud takes a key, local takes models); an optional
``"mode"`` field states the side explicitly and must agree with the
other keys. The ``"pageindex-cloud"`` string is the label spelling for
"this side is managed" — a synonym of ``"cloud"``.
